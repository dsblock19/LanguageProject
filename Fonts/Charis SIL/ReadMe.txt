Charis SIL Modified

This is a modified version of Charis SIL. It also includes a SmallCaps version. The weight has been increased so it looks better on eInk screens.

For the Kindle, the line spacing has been set so it gives a lesser space in KF8 eBooks. If you want a smaller line space, use the Chris SIL Compact fonts.
